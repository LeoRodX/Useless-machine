Useless machine (timeless)
A useless machine is entertainment, 
which should be constantly ready to surprise the guest,
ready to stand on the shelf for months 
wait for the guest to pay attention to him, 
then immediately start entertaining the guest without prior manipulation,
for example, turning on the power switch or charging
... and simple to repeat.
Therefore, any jewelry box from the store for creativity is suitable for the device body,
available modules are used, everything is attached to a thermal adhesive,
handle (toggle switch pusher) made of copper wire with soldering for rigidity,    
There is a power saving timer for complete power off, 
the only toggle switch turns on the power and functionality of the device.
